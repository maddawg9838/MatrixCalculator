# Matrix Operations Program

## Overview
This C++ program allows users to perform various matrix operations, including addition, multiplication, and transposing matrices. It provides an interactive menu for users to select their desired operation and input the necessary matrix data.

## Features
- **Matrix Addition**: Add multiple matrices of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices, ensuring dimensional compatibility
- **Matrix Transpose**: Calculate the transpose of a matrix.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple text-based menu for easy navigation

## How to Use
1. **Run the Program**: Compile the execute the program in a C++ environment.
2. **Choose an Operation**: Select an operation from the menu
3. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the required matrix dimensions and elements.
4. **Repeat or Exit**: After completing an operation, you can choose to continue with another operation or exit the program.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (like g++) to run the code

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MatrixOperations.git
cd MatrixOperations
```
2. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ -o MatrixOperations MatrixOperations.cpp
```
3. Run the program:
```bash
./MatrixOperations
```

## Code Overview
The program consists of multiple functions that handle matrix operations and user interactions.

## Key Functions
- addition(): Handles the addition of multiple matrices.
- multiplication(): Manages the multiplication of two matrices.
- transpose(): Computes the transpose of a matrix.
- redo(): Prompts the user to continue or exit the program.
